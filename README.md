## ‚ùì FAQ <a name="faq"></a>

### How do I get my own data?

There are tons of Forza Telemetry apps out there, but I personally use my [Forza Telemetry](https://github.com/austinbaccus/forza-telemetry) project to record data.

### Why does it take a while for the program to finish sometimes?

The animaition scripts take a lot of time to run, and it also takes a while to save the animations as GIFs. The more data you're including, the longer it will take.
